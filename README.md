# PyTorch-Object-Segmentation
Guided Project on Object Segmentation in PyTorch from Coursera

This project was a small, guided project that let me learn Object Segmentation using PyTorch. EfficientNet encoder with ImageNet weights were used for training on a small dataset consisting of images and their masks.

Skills learned: Mathematical Optimization, Convolutional Neural Networks, Autoencoders, PyTorch, Python
